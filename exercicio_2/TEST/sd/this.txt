t.set_color('grey')
for autotext in autotexts:
    autotext.set_color('grey')
# Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle
ax1.axis('equal')  
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Now our pie chart looks something like this:

color changes of labels
Changing the pie chart to donut chart to look more cool and AWESOME!!
Method of making donut graph from pie chart in MatPlotLib documentation is complicated rather we can just change the pie chart to donut chart by drawing a circle with white color at origin(Source: here).
Modify code as below to draw a circle centered at (0,0)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Pie chart
labels = ['Frogs', 'Hogs', 'Dogs', 'Logs']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]
#colors
colors = ['#ff9999','#66b3ff','#99ff99','#ffcc99']
 
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.pie(sizes, colors = colors, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
#draw circle
centre_circle = plt.Circle((0,0),0.70,fc='white')
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.gca().add_artist(centre_circle)
# Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle
ax1.axis('equal')  
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
